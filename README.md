# ABM-dynamic-supermarket-pricing
 ABM: for a model with dynamic supermarket pricing.


The main model is shown is called clean_main.py. This model can be run with python.
The parameters for the model can be found in PARAMETERS.py, here the number of simulations,
simulation lenght and other parameters can be changed.

analysis_multiple_simulations copy.ipynb an analysis can be done if the number of
simulations is greater then 1. 

analysis_single_simulations.ipynb an analysis can be done is the number of 
simulations is equal to 1.

data from previous experiments can be found in the directories, with the used
parameter file for the simulation.

low stands for: price_adjustment = 2
mid stands for: price_adjustment = 5
high stands for: price_adjustment = 10
